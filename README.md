### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Kate Cook - Future-Forward Coder & Explorer ðŸš€

I am a full-stack developer with a strong interest in front-end development and UI and UX design.

Constantly trying to find new ways to design applications, websites, and programs, I focus on both functionality and aesthetics. Why have something that works if no one wants to use it because it's not appealing!? 

I am a part of all spheres of life as a blogger, social media enthusiast, artist, and self-proclaimed scientist (if Googling can count as research)ðŸ”­. 

I am currently obtaining a UX certificate from Google and am seeking a job within the tech industry!

Welcome to my Github! please contact me at Katecookk4@gmail.comðŸ˜„








I am in a perpetual Beta mode, a "wannabe" Geek, a Social Media and Communication addict.

Also, a recruitment and sourcing specialist, having around 7 years of enriched experience in hiring Mechanical, IT & Non-IT professionals across the globe. I am a Portal & Social Media sourcing expert currently hiring for diversified roles in and around different cities of Europe & APJ.

I do have proven experience in recruiting IT talent, availing of job boards and vendor sourcing partnerships with top Startups, Midsize Product Organizations, Multibillion Conglomerates.

I handle the recruitment cycle for Middle, Senior and Top Management levels.

âœ” What do I do?


I convert People to Candidates which means I work with internal recruiters and on their behalf, I identify, contact and engage with highly qualified professionals. My goal is to understand these peopleâ€™s motivations and just propose them to be introduced to the recruiter/HR person. Mainly for hard-to-fill positions."
