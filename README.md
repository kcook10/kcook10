### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Kate Cook - Future-Forward Coder & Explorer ðŸš€

I am a full-stack developer with a strong interest in front-end development and UI and UX design.

Constantly trying to find new ways to design applications, websites, and programs, I focus on both functionality and aesthetics. Why have something that works if no one wants to use it because it's not appealing!? 

I am a part of all spheres of life as a blogger, social media enthusiast, artist, and self-proclaimed scientist (if Googling can count as research)ðŸ”­. 

I am currently obtaining a UX certificate from Google and am seeking a job within the tech industry!
